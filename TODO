TODO
----

* what is the best way to create iterators from Haskell to pass to C?
* do we need to ensure a closed writable database on exit?
* unsafePerformIO is bad.
* data is stored as UTF8, which underlying text representation is appropriate?
* databases may throw Xapian::DatabaseCorruptError or Xapian::DatabaseLockError
  while opening
* apply Tibell's style guide

maybe...
* allow for custom stem algorithms in Haskell

from the docs:
* spelling correction
* sorting results
* thesaurus
