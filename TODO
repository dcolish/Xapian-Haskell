TODO
----

* reduce boilerplate in nullify/unnullify
* unify terms and postings
* some objects are not being deleted such as iterators. can we reconcile this
  with lazy IO (unsafeInterleaveIO)?
* make Cabal link the c++ object files
* unpack Op-datatypes in module Query
* make sure, that any exception in the c bindings is caught
* what is the best way to create iterators from Haskell to pass to C?
* do we need to ensure a closed writable database on exit?
* unsafePerformIO is bad.
* data is stored as UTF8, which underlying text representation is appropriate?
* databases may throw Xapian::DatabaseCorruptError or Xapian::DatabaseLockError
  while opening
* apply Tibell's style guide

maybe...
* allow for custom stem algorithms in Haskell
* we can optimise queries like HaskellDB does with `optimize :: PrimQuery -> PrimQuery`

from the docs:
* spelling correction
* sorting results
* thesaurus
